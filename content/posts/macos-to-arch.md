### Intro
I have been a macOS user for at least 13 years. Lately all big techs are pushing AI into every aspect of our lives, everything we interact with seems to have embedded AI.

Computers are designed to execute tasks that we order them to execute, this is done with the help of the operating system which is the interface between the us humans and the hardware.

The most used OSes, Windows and macOS keep adding things that makes it "bloated", new versions will consume more memory than the previous one, you need to buy a new machine to be compatible with their AI garbage.

Even though these machines are labeled obsolete to run their OS if you install any Linux distro these machines are "revived" and they will keep working for a long time.
